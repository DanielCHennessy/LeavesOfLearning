RTS version history

v 0.1.0 - Initial handover of code from Dr. Dan to students

Basic RTS working - can select units by clicking, have them move
and attack.  Crystals and mining is set up.  Status bar at bottom
of screen has build buttons that work so that the command center
can build miners, etc.  Network code is not yet functional, so
games are solo against a dummy AI that does nothing, at least for
the instant.  Units in place: Miner, soldier, tank.  Buildings in
place: command center, laser turret, scaffolding.  Objects in
place: crystal, explosion.
